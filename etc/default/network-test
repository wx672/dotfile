# Defaults for ifupdown-extra testing scripts
# sourced by scripts at /etc/network/if-{pre-,-}up.d
# installed at /etc/default/network-test by the maintainer scripts
# while respecting exported shell environment variables

# Tells scripts to log to syslog the tests done before an interface
# is configured. Set this to "no" if you just want to use stderr
DO_SYSLOG=${DO_SYSLOG:-yes}

# Abort scripts (do not continue) if the network link is not up
ABORT_NO_LINK=${ABORT_NO_LINK:-no}

# Additional options that are passed to ARPING scripts
#
# DO_ARPING tells the scripts to test if an IPv4 or IPv6 address is already
# assigned in the network (using arping for IPv4 and ndisc6 for IPv6, if
# available). The scripts provided will log this event to syslog and can be
# used to detect network configuration errors.
#
# Please bear in mind that these type of network probes will introduce a delay
# when configuring the interface (if everything is OK) since the scripts will
# have to wait until the tool sends the probes and finishes before configuring
# an interface. Set this to 'no' if you do not want this delay and want to skip
# these tests.
DO_ARPING=${DO_ARPING:-yes}
#
# These values control how many arp pings are sent when doing ARP tests
# The higher the count (or timeout) the more time it will take for those
# scripts to finish but it might make it more easy to detect faulty
# counditions in overloaded networks.
ARP_COUNT=${ARP_COUNT:-2}
ARP_TIMEOUT=${ARP_TIMEOUT:-3}
