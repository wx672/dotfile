# At server side:

- `/etc/default/tmate-ssh-server`: command line options
- `/etc/tmate-ssh-server/keys`: don't change file names!
- server started by systemd.
- [ ] need websocket server to enable named session

# At client side:
- use sha256 fingerprint. the md5 example in README.Debian doesn't work.
- edit `~/.tmate.conf`
