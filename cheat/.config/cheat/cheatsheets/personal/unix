# This is the Unix philosophy

Doug McIlroy:

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well. 
- Write programs to work together. 
- Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

Doug invented UNIX pipes, so yeah.

From Mike Gancarz (who helped create X):

1.  Small is beautiful.
2.  Make each program do one thing well.
3.  Build a prototype as soon as possible.
4.  Choose portability over efficiency.
5.  Store data in flat text files.
6.  Use software leverage to your advantage.
7.  Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
8.  Avoid captive user interfaces.
9.  Make every program a filter.
