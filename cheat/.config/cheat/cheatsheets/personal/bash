$# --- Number of command-line arguments or positional parameters
$* --- All of the positional parameters, seen as a single word. "$*" must be quoted.
$@ --- Same as $*, but each parameter is a quoted string, that is, the parameters are passed on intact, without interpretation or expansion. This means, among other things, that each parameter in the argument list is seen as a separate word. Of course, "$@" should be quoted.
