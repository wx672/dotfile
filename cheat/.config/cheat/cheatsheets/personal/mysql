# Reset root password

- There is no need to reset root password. The better way is to use *unix_socket authentication* instead:

```sh
sudo mysql -u root
```

- After a fresh install of MariaDB, run `sudo mariadb-secure-installation`.

- In case you really want to set a new root password:

	```sh
	sudo mysql -u root
	```

	```sql
	use mysql;
	ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_new_password';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	```
