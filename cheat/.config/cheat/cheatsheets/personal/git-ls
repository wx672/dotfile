# deleted files and modified files (deleted files are also counted as
# modified, so may come up twice...)
git ls-files -d -m

# what's in the index; includes files that were "git add"ed
git ls-files -s
git ls-files -u # conflicted files

# "other files"; includes EVERYthing not in d/m/s, I think
git ls-files -o # seems to be equal to untracked + ignored
git ls-files -o --exclude-standard # untracked files only
git ls-files -o --exclude-standard -i # ignored files only
